# The eye tracking guide

In this chapter, we will find your optimal eye-tracking solution.
We start with the simplest solutions such as pen and paper, then work our way through inexpensive or even free software and hardware, and finish with ready-made complete solutions from major manufacturers.
The aim is to work with as little expenditure as possible.
Because sometimes it doesn't take that much for a good eye-tracking result.
You may already have everything you need at home.

Unfortunately, you will have to experiment a little.
Not every solution is suitable for every person and every environment.
However, we have gone to great lengths to make the software, hardware and our knowledge as accessible as possible.
If you still have questions or suggestions, [do not hesitate to contact us](/en/06-miscellaneous/contact).

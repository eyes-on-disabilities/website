# Smartphone

Smartphones are very suitable for use as simple eye-trackers due to their availability and low weight.

## Android

_With the “Look-to-Speak" app, text blocks can be selected with the eye and played back as voice output. [© Google](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OhaTD2FcdRkk7Qq741qVD-VWC4OIz11o-2IChz3hASsrrRNIpVpbUBFiMHLGrGAVcoEMccTEGnqbYS1_aInZLeemtZI)_

If you have an Android smartphone, you can try out the free "Look-to-Speak" app; an app where predefined texts are selected by looking left and right and played back as voice output.
The app can be downloaded from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.androidexperiments.looktospeak).
There is also a short [instruction manual as PDF](https://storage.googleapis.com/experiments-uploads/LTS_GUIDE.pdf).

If you have an iPhone with iOS18, you can now also activate the eye-tracking function and use it to operate your smartphone.
How to activate this function and which models support iOS18 can be found [on the Apple website](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/control-iphone-with-the-movement-of-your-eyes-iph66057d0f6/ios).

# Safety with Infrared Radiation

Infrared radiation is often used in eye and head tracking. Infrared offers several advantages: the pupil is more easily identifiable under infrared light, and infrared-based trackers can function even in darkness. However, certain safety precautions need to be followed. This section contains information about the safe use of infrared radiation near the eye.

::: warning Tip 2: Safety Guidelines for Infrared Radiation near the Eye
At this moment, we cannot fully assess the risks of infrared radiation on the eye. We are currently conducting research and will publish our findings soon.

Whether or not we have results, we encourage you to make your own informed decision about the potential risks. Please feel free to use this section as a starting point.

## Prerequisite Knowledge: Radiometry

Basic knowledge of radiometry is required.

Lecture PDFs:

- From the University of Berkeley: https://cs184.eecs.berkeley.edu/public/sp19/lectures/lec-11-radiometry/lec-11-radiometry.pdf
- From Stanford University: https://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs348b-03/lectures/radiometry-1.pdf

Alternatively, Video Lectures:

- A 50-minute lecture: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLfYTP4F23g
- An 8-minute video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tflz0loWhIY

By the end, the following units should be understood:

- Geometric units like angles in radians and solid angles in steradians
- Power and energy units like watts and joules
- Radiometric quantities such as radiant flux, irradiance, radiant power density, and luminous intensity

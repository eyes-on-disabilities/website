# Hello World ðŸ‘‹:<br>Introduction to Development & Wiki

If you're looking to dive deeper into the subject or even contribute to the development of _Eyes on (Dis)Abilities_, you're in the right place.
Here, you'll find a collection of information on various topics, including technical details and development-related contentâ€”though not everything is necessarily related to eye-tracking.
The chapters in this section aren't organized, and some might just be brief notes.
We hope, though, that you'll find your way around and take away something useful.

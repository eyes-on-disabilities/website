# About Us

We are a joint volunteer project of the IFB-Stiftung and CCC Wiesbaden e.V.

Our goal is to provide affordable or even free eye- and head-tracking solutions for individuals affected by motor neuron diseases or movement-restricting disabilities.

Our work is volunteer-driven, and both our software and hardware are open-source and free of as in libre.

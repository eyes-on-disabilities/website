## How can I get involved? What needs to be done?

First of all: Thank you for wanting to help us!
If you can code: You’ll find our code on GitHub: [github.com/eyes-on-disabilities](https://github.com/eyes-on-disabilities).
But you absolutely don’t need to be able to code to support us.

Here are some things that currently (as of July 2025) need to be done:

- Write content:
  You could improve existing texts or even write new introductions or build guides.
  Maybe our wording is still too complex, or our writing is too convoluted.
  Or you could translate texts into plain language.

- Test build guides and give feedback:
  Try building what we suggest.
  You might run into issues we hadn’t considered or discover simpler ways to do it.

- Find additional software or hardware:
  Do you know of tools or tech we’ve missed? Let us know!

- 3D modeling and printing:
  The module we attach to our glasses could use a nicer casing.
  Being able to 3D print a proper enclosure would be amazing.
  For that, we need a solid 3D model that prints well.

- Mobile development:
  Phones are abundant and would be great as a quick eye-tracking solution.
  But we lack experience in mobile development.
  Maybe you can help?

- Simplify the software:
  Especially for the glasses setup, our software stack is still too complex. There’s a lot to do.
  Too many tools need to be installed, and they’re often too technical or hard to use.
  Possible tasks include:

  - Writing Windows install scripts that bundle multiple tools.
  - Figuring out how to make a Python project into a .exe that Windows Defender won’t flag.
  - Finding simpler alternatives to the Pupil eye-tracking software.
  - Fixing small bugs or implementing usability features in our interface software.

## How Your Donations Are Used

Donations typically go towards purchasing hardware and assistive devices.
For example, they help us build custom computer systems and input devices for gamers with disabilities.
They may also cover server infrastructure costs or the purchase of new components for eye-tracking technology, enabling people affected by ALS and other motor neuron diseases to communicate again.

Whatever the use, our goal is always to help people participate more fully, whether in gaming or in daily life.

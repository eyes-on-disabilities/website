_EyeTrackVR_ offers both software and hardware, along with detailed assembly instructions for creating an eye-tracking system.
Using cost-effective infrared cameras and lights, it meets many of the requirements for wearable eye-tracking.

The project is well-documented and provides an affordable way to experiment with eye-tracking technology.
We see great potential in this initiative and look forward to exploring it further and adapting it for our audience's needs.

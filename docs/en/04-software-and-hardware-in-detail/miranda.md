Miranda is an interface, much like Opentrack, that bridges eye- and head-tracker inputs and outputs, focusing on screen calibration.
It allows seamless integration with other applications, enabling versatile use of calibrated tracking data.

For example, Opentrack or Pupil can be used as an input source, the tracker data is calibrated for the screen, and then passed to another application like OptiKey.
In simple terms, Miranda connects OpenTrack or Pupil with OptiKey.

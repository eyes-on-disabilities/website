OpenTrack is a software that connects a wide range of input devices for head- and eye-tracking with output devices.
Some trackers are directly integrated into OpenTrack and require no additional software, such as [tracking with printable codes](https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack/wiki/Aruco-tracker).
